# Recycle Bin Feature Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented a centralized **Recycle Bin** page to restore soft-deleted users and tenants, replacing the previous inline restore button approach for better UX.

## ✅ Changes Completed

### 1. Backend Restore APIs (Already Implemented)
- **User Restore**: `PUT /api/users/:id/restore`
  - Sets `status='active'`, `deleted_at=NULL`
  - Protected by `users:update` permission
  - Located in: `api/src/services/UserService.js` (lines 339-358)

- **Tenant Restore**: `PUT /api/tenants/:id/restore`
  - Sets `status='active'`, `updated_at=NOW()`
  - Protected by `tenants:update` permission
  - Located in: `api/src/services/TenantService.js` (lines 340-359)

### 2. Frontend Service Updates

#### User Service (`web/src/app/core/services/user.service.ts`)
- ✅ Added `deletedAt?: string | null` to User interface
- ✅ Updated status type to include `'deleted'`
- ✅ Implemented `restoreUser(userId: string)` method (lines 237-263)

### 3. Users List Component (`web/src/app/features/admin/users/users-list.component.ts`)
- ✅ Removed inline restore button from template
- ✅ Removed `restoreUser()` method from component
- ✅ Updated `filteredUsers()` getter to **exclude deleted users by default**
  - Deleted users only show when explicitly filtered
  - This ensures clean separation: active users in main list, deleted users in Recycle Bin

### 4. Recycle Bin Component (`web/src/app/features/admin/recycle-bin/recycle-bin.component.ts`)

#### Features:
- **Two Tabs**: Users and Tenants
- **Users Tab**:
  - Displays all users where `status='deleted'`
  - Shows: Name, Email, Roles, Deleted Date
  - Restore button (calls `UserService.restoreUser()`)
  - Permission: `users:update` required

- **Tenants Tab**:
  - Displays all tenants where `status='deleted'`
  - Shows: Name, Slug, Plan, Deleted Date
  - Restore button (calls backend directly via HTTP)
  - Permission: `tenants:update` required

#### Technical Details:
- Uses computed signals for reactive filtering
- Confirmation dialogs before restore
- Success/error notifications
- Loading states for both tabs
- Empty states when no deleted items
- Loads data on component init

### 5. Sidebar Navigation (`web/src/app/shared/components/sidebar/sidebar.component.ts`)
- ✅ Added "Recycle Bin" menu item with 🗑️ icon
- Positioned after "Users" section
- Protected by `anyPermission: ['users:update', 'tenants:update']`
- Shows badge count (coming from computed signals in component)

### 6. Routing (`web/src/app/app.routes.ts`)
- ✅ Added route: `/admin/recycle-bin`
- Lazy-loaded component
- Protected by `systemAdminGuard`

## 🎯 How It Works

### Soft Delete Flow:
1. Admin clicks "Delete" on user/tenant in management list
2. Backend sets `status='deleted'` and `deleted_at=NOW()`
3. Item disappears from main management list (filtered out)
4. Item appears in Recycle Bin under appropriate tab

### Restore Flow:
1. Admin navigates to Recycle Bin (sidebar menu)
2. Selects "Users" or "Tenants" tab
3. Clicks "Restore" button on deleted item
4. Confirmation dialog appears
5. Backend sets `status='active'` and clears `deleted_at`
6. Item disappears from Recycle Bin
7. Item reappears in main management list
8. Success notification shown

## 🔒 Permissions

| Action | Required Permission |
|--------|-------------------|
| View Recycle Bin | `users:update` OR `tenants:update` |
| Restore User | `users:update` |
| Restore Tenant | `tenants:update` |
| Delete User | `users:delete` |
| Delete Tenant | `tenants:delete` |

## 📋 User Experience Improvements

### Before (Inline Restore):
- ❌ Restore buttons scattered across management pages
- ❌ Deleted items mixed with active items
- ❌ No centralized view of deleted items
- ❌ Harder to find what was deleted

### After (Recycle Bin):
- ✅ Single location for all deleted items
- ✅ Clear separation: active vs deleted
- ✅ Familiar pattern (like email trash folders)
- ✅ Better bulk operations support (future)
- ✅ Cleaner management interfaces

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### User Restore:
- [ ] Delete a user from Users management page
- [ ] Verify user disappears from main list
- [ ] Navigate to Recycle Bin → Users tab
- [ ] Verify deleted user appears with correct data
- [ ] Click "Restore" button
- [ ] Confirm in dialog
- [ ] Verify success message
- [ ] Navigate back to Users management
- [ ] Verify user reappears with `status='active'`

### Tenant Restore:
- [ ] Delete a tenant from Tenants management page
- [ ] Verify tenant disappears from main list
- [ ] Navigate to Recycle Bin → Tenants tab
- [ ] Verify deleted tenant appears with correct data
- [ ] Click "Restore" button
- [ ] Confirm in dialog
- [ ] Verify success message
- [ ] Navigate back to Tenants management
- [ ] Verify tenant reappears with `status='active'`

### Permissions:
- [ ] Test with user having only `users:update` → Can restore users only
- [ ] Test with user having only `tenants:update` → Can restore tenants only
- [ ] Test with user having neither → Cannot see Recycle Bin menu item

### Edge Cases:
- [ ] Restore when 0 deleted items (empty state shows)
- [ ] Multiple deleted items in both tabs
- [ ] Filter users by "Deleted" status in main list (should show deleted items)
- [ ] Error handling (network failure during restore)

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

1. **Permanent Delete**: Add ability to permanently delete from Recycle Bin
2. **Auto-Expiry**: Automatically permanently delete items after 30 days
3. **Bulk Restore**: Select multiple items and restore at once
4. **Search & Filter**: Search deleted items by name/email
5. **Roles Tab**: Add restore functionality for deleted roles
6. **Audit Log**: Show who deleted and who restored each item
7. **Restore Preview**: Show what will happen when restoring (e.g., conflicts)

## 📝 Notes

- Backend restore endpoints were already implemented in previous phase
- Soft delete is used throughout (data is never actually removed from database)
- Deleted items are excluded from all counts and statistics
- The "Deleted" filter option in main lists still works (shows deleted items if explicitly selected)
- All restore operations include confirmation dialogs and success/error notifications
- Component uses Angular signals for reactive state management
- Both tabs load data independently and show appropriate loading states

## ✅ Implementation Complete

All 8 planned tasks have been completed:
1. ✅ Remove restore button from users-list template
2. ✅ Update users filter to exclude deleted by default
3. ✅ Add 'Recycle Bin' menu item to sidebar
4. ✅ Create recycle-bin.component.ts
5. ✅ Implement Users tab in Recycle Bin
6. ✅ Implement Tenants tab in Recycle Bin
7. ✅ Add route for Recycle Bin
8. ⏳ Ready for testing

**Status**: Ready for user acceptance testing!
